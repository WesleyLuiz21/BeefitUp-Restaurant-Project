## UI/UX


### Wireframes

* The Website's sketch and wireframe was created in Figma as I felt more confortable with it.
* I've decided to create a wireframe/sketch and then design the whole project with Figma.
* Open the image in a new tab if possible to be able to actually see the sketch image.

### Design

* I've decided to make more complex wireframes with Figma, as I felt it would save me time having the entire page design ready to be built
* I tried to build the website following every page design carefully.

#### Main Page Design/Wireframe

#### Design Choices

* I've decided the make my own logo using the matching color scheme(red and white for the text).
* I've decided to make the logo as SVG file so I could use it for both the navigation bar and Home page.

#### Color Choices

* The color scheme I selected was red, gray, white and black.
* There is two tons of gray, one is to the p text color and the darker one is to the Restaurant Locations card.
* I have added a light gray color to the p elements to diferentiate the p elements from the h1,h2... while still looking good.
* I have choose the red color to be the contrast color of the design, mainly because it is a warm color and can remind of fire/fireplaces and meat.
* I have choose the black color as the background color as it doesn't make the text hard to read while making a good match with red and white.


#### Images

* All images were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
* The Unsplash Extension in Figma was very handy, making possible searching for the right images, free of copyrights.
* Then I was able to get to the image page in the Unsplash website through Figma.

#### Fonts 

* Permanent Marker - I choose this one because it gives a Restaurant Menu title feeling.(I found this font accidentally by playing with fonts in Figma/Photoshop and I felt it would fit the project design).

* Source Sans Pro - I choose this one to the general text and to have an actual normal font.

## Technologies

* HTML
   * Developed with HTML5.
* CSS3
   * Website styled with CSS3.
* Javascript (just a small script)
   * Added a small script to change the background color of the navigation bar when the user scroll up and down.
* Bootstrap 5
   * Website's structure build with Bootstrap 5.0.2 and custom css
* VS Code
   * Developed the entire Website using VS Code as I felt more confortable with it.
* Git
   * Used Git bash to push and commit code.
* Github
   * Used to host the source code and Git Pages to deploy the website. 
* Font Awesome
   * Used Font Awesome library to add the social media icons and the hamburger navigation icon.
* Google Fonts API
   * Used to select the fonts I've choosen for the project.
* Figma
   * Used to sketch, wireframe and design the whole project.
* Figma Unsplash Extension
   * Used to obtain high quality images free of copyrights to the project.

## Deployment

* I was supposed to use Gitpod for this project, however I have decided to use the desktop VS Code as I'm very familiar with it and I felt like Gitpod would slow me down.


## Bugs 

* The initial plan was to use Bootstrap 6, however I had to go back to bootstrap 5 as I been struggling to make things work and I felt like it was a better choice overall.
* At first, in the process of creating the navigation bar with bootstrap, the code wasn't behaving the way it was supposed to be.
  * Fixed by reading the bootstrap 5 documentation carefully and decided to use the bootstrap navigation template.

  * Stackoverflow and Bootstrap 5 documentation were used to solve all issues/bugs.
  * ChatGPT(or OpenIA) was used to generate random adresses in central london and restaurant description/about/goal in the About Section and then tweaked to fit the website/design(It was quite handy!).
